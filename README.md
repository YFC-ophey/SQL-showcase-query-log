![tables_users&photos.png](sql_showcase_query_log/tables_usersphotos.png)

**Pro Tip** ‚Üí Use `user_id` and `photo_id` / `follower_id` and `followee_id`as  combinations of PRIMARY KEY, making sure no data is duplicated.

- **Insights:** 13 users who have liked every single photo on Instagram have been identified, with a total of 257 likes each. We can suggest look deeper into the possibility of bots or fake accounts, which can skew our engagement metrics.

- **Request:** Marketing Lead requests to look into users‚Äô details regarding number of likes level, the section ranking of each group, and the overall ranking of each user.

    - Retrieves user information, including ID, username, and creation date, along with the number of likes received.
    - Calculates the ranking of each user based on the number of likes received, including their overall rank and dense rank.
    - Joins the subquery of users and likes tables and then groups the result by user.
    - The **`WINDOW`** function is used to partition the data by **`PARTITION BY`**  the number of likes into groups of row.
        
        ![Snap_Q9.png](sql_showcase_query_log/Snap_Q9.png)
        
- **Insights:**
    - The data indicates that there are several groups of users who have liked a significant number of photos on Instagram but are not part of the highest group of 13 users. It is essential to keep track of these users' likes to measure their engagement on the platform. Moreover, the engagement metrics can be skewed if these 13 users are bots or fake accounts.
    - Among these 13 users, the top-ranked user is Nia_Haag, who has been on Instagram since May, 2016 and has liked all the photos on the platform. She is followed by Bethany20, Mike.Auer39, Mckenna17, and Janelle.Nikolaus81, who have also liked all the photos on Instagram. The least ranked among these users is Maxwell.Halvorson, who has also liked all the photos on the platform but has the least number of followers.
    - Recommend conducting a further investigation on the 13 users to identify whether they are genuine or fake accounts. This investigation should involve a closer look at their profiles, followers, and comments to understand their behavior and motive.

![teamsmemes-chat10.jpeg](sql_showcase_query_log/teamsmemes-chat10.jpeg)

- **Request:** Find out users with more than 200 comments and higher followers engagement total above 5,000.

    - Join the users and comments tables, and calculates the total number of comments and the number of comments with higher followers engagement.
    - Sort to display only users with more than 200 comments and higher followers engagement total above 5,000.
        
        ![Snap_Q10.png](sql_showcase_query_log/Snap_Q10.png)
        
- **Insights:**
    - Based on the data above, the 13 users have exact equal number of comments and likes compared to their significant higher number of followers engagements. This indicates that they may not be genuine users, but rather fake accounts created for the purpose of artificially boosting engagement, which is a common tactic used by some marketers to create the appearance of popularity.
    - It is crucial to query out these 13 users‚Äô comments and engagements to ensure that our platform maintains its integrity and provides marketing team members with accurate data.
